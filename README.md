    ## Description
    Producing a README is a vital part of development work as it is the front door to your initiatives. This tool streamlines that process using best practices for README format.

    ## Installation
    This requires Node.js. Once that is installed, you will need to use the FileSystem package built in, as well as Inquirer. This tool uses Inquirer 8.2.4. To install, type "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" in your terminal. All necessary dependencies will be installed from there.

    ## Usage
    Initialize the prompt by typing "node index" in your terminal. Answer the questions and this should generate your README.

    ## Contributing
    Any additional guidance on code-cleaning and best practices is always appreciated. Additional tools or implementations are welcome, as well.

    ## Tests
    The produced file can either be deleted or overwritten with this program. Running it using any values is welcome. There are, however, question dependencies, so incorrect formatting in specific answers (i.e. third-party assets, etc.) will cause issues and my not populate in the README correctly.
